## Crossword data

This is an example of the JSON data required to create the crossword shown above. Its structure is defined by the [GuardianCrossword](./src/interfaces/GuardianCrossword.ts) interface.

```

  id: 'simple/1',
  number: 1,
  name: 'Simple Crossword #1',
  date: 1542326400000,
  entries: [
    {
      id: '1-across',
      number: 1,
      humanNumber: '1',
      clue: 'Toy on a string (2-2)',
      direction: 'across',
      length: 4,
      group: ['1-across'],
      position: { x: 0, y: 0 },

      solution: 'ENDS',
    },
  ],

## Guess grid

Some functions require or return the state of the crossword grid. This is a 2-dimensional array holding the user's guess for each cell. Incomplete cells or cells that are not part of any answer are represented as the empty string (`""`). Note that it follows the convention of indexing by column first (x) and then row (y) so the printed array is transposed compared to how the crossword grid appears. For example, the following crossword...

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>■</td>
    <td>D</td>
    <td>■</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>■</td>
    <td>O</td>
    <td>■</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>A</td>
    <td>G</td>
    <td>E</td>
  </tr>
</table>

...would be represented as...

```JSON
{
  "value": [
    ["",  "",  "A"],
    ["D", "O", "G"],
    ["",  "",  "E"]
  ]
}
```

## What's new?

While the project has been created from scratch, it should be considered as a continuation of [@guardian](https://github.com/guardian)/[react-crossword](https://github.com/guardian/react-crossword). With that in mind, here's a list of improvements when compared to the original:

### Technical improvements

- Use of TypeScript
- Built with Vite
- Switched to functional components
- Better performance (memoization, useCallback etc.)
- Simplified global state management using Zustand
- More modular component hierarchy
- Scoped CSS
- Full unit test coverage
- CI using GitHub actions

### Functional improvements

- Theme styles
- Combined buttons to use dropdown menus
- Check/Reveal letter
- Arrow keys can skip over dark cells
- Backspace key moves backwards without the cell having to be empty
- Anagram helper
  - Click clue words to add to anagram
  - Added letter to centre of word wheel
  - Character counter
  - Escape key to clear/close
  - Show missing letters from grid
- Removed hidden input and implicitly fixed the window resize bug
- Fixed HTML display in StickyClue and AnagramHelper
- Better loading and error state display
