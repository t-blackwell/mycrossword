Can include HTML tags for formatting                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

For standalone clues it consists of a single element, the `id` of this entry, e.g. `['1-across']`. For solutions that are split over multiple entries in the diagram, it's an array of entry `id`s in the order that the clue is read.                                                                       |

For the first in a set of linked entries it should be e.g. `'1, 2'` or `'1, 2 down'`, where the explicit `'across'` or `'down'` identifier is usually omitted for any linked entries that are in the same direction as this one.                                                          |

For linked entries it's the length of this part only. Should match the number of characters in `solution`.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `separatorLocations` | `{ ','?: number[] \| undefined;  '-'?: number[] \| undefined;}` | required  | Arrays of indices indicating positions of any spaces (`','`) and hyphens (`'-'`) in the solution. E.g. `{}` for a solution with no spaces/hyphens. For the solution 'FIVE-POUND NOTE' it would be `{ ',': [9], '-': [4] }`: the numbers indicate which (1-indexed) character the separator should appear _after_. Used to decorate the grid with hyphens / thick bars. |
| `solution`           | `string`                                                        | optional  | Solution (excluding spaces and punctuation) in upper case, e.g. `'FIVEPOUNDNOTE'`. Used for 'Check' and 'Reveal' functions if `solutionAvailable` is `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
